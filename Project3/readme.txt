1. The dataset we used in project 3 is MovieLens dataset which consists of 100,000 ratings (1-5) from 943 users on 1682 movies.
   The corresponding data file is "u.data" which is in the directory ~/nmfv1_4/ml-100k.

2. To run our source codes, please put all the source code files into nmfv1_4 folder 
   which contains source code files of Matrix Factorization Toolbox in MATLAB.

3. The "Matlab Data & Figure" folder contains running result of each problem and the figures we used in the report.
   You can use MATLAB to load the MATLAB Data files (.mat) into workspace to check the result of each problem.
